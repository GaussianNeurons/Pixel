# Welcome to Pixel!
**Pixel** is an application designed to promote and gamify financial literacy for the pre-teens and teens. As children learn to save and manage their money, NFTs are unlocked when savings goals are met. Children can browse their NFT collection and swap them on the open marketplace, learning the core fundamentals of market making. Furthermore, as these NFTs are stored in their Ethereum wallet address, they can be imported and used in various Metaverse and decentralized games popular among teens.  Hundreds of pixels make up an NFT, but only **ONE** Pixel empowers teens to start their financial journey.
